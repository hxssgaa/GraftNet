1. Vocab problem, vocabulary should include the relations. Currently, no relation vocabulary included.
2. Try to understand if GraftNet Actually used the relation embedding.
3. Try to implement PullNet, pull_facts function should be the key.

New Issue:
1. PullNet is not learnable, try to figure why pull facts can't be learned.
2. If PullNet fails. Try to integrate approximated weighted page rank with PullNet. Train first hop and then second hop
    and so on.
